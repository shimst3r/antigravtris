# Antigravtris

[Antigravtris](https://github.com/shimst3r/antigravtris) is a variant of [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) originally created by [Alexey Pajitnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov) in 1984.

It is meant to be a game study for my own learning purposes, targetting the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console by [@zep](https://mastodon.social/@zep). I want to pursue the idea of varying gravity in the game of Tetris and how this changes its game mechanics.

You can either download the proper binary for your operating system (check the [releases page](https://github.com/shimst3r/antigravtris/releases/tag/v1.0.0)) or use the [web version](https://shimst3r.xyz/antigravtris).

Thanks for your time! ðŸ˜„
